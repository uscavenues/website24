        <p class="blurbbl" style="font-size: 2vw;">&#9998; Do I need previous experience to be accepted?</p>
        <p class="blurbbl ">No! Many of our past cohort members have 
          had <span class="red">little to no experience</span> for their specific role, and have been successful within our 
          organization. In fact, we especially <span class="pink">strongly encourage project-builders (design and tech) to apply 
          no matter your current skill level.</p>
          
          <p class="blurbbl" style="margin-top: 3vw; font-size: 2vw;">&#9998; For the portfolio section, what kind of work is best to submit?</p>
        <p class="blurbbl ">We know that our applicants have varying levels of experience based on grade level and other factors,
          so we don't necessarily have a preferred submission type. However, we encourage you to submit work that
          fully reflects your <span class="pink">current skillset</span>, and maybe even your personality, too.</p>

        <p class="blurbbl" style="margin-top: 3vw; font-size: 2vw;" >&#9998; What can I expect during the interview rounds?</p>
        <p class="blurbbl ">In the first round, individual candidates will be interviewed by 1 or 2 E-Board members. It will consist
          of a behavioral and technical component, and should last no longer than 30 minutes. The second round will
          be a panel-style case interview completed in groups rather than individually. </p>

        <p class="blurbbl" style="margin-top: 3vw; font-size: 2vw;" >&#9998; Am I allowed to use tools like ChatGPT to help me write my application?</p>
        <p class="blurbbl ">Yes, you may. However, you should make it clear that you used ChatGPT if you choose to. If you do not make note
          of your usage, but we find that you did use it, it will be reflected on your application review.
          Further, <span class="pink">we recommend not using ChatGPT</span> to write your answers at all.</p>

        <p class="blurbbl" style="margin-top: 3vw; font-size: 2vw;" >&#9998; Is it easier to get an offer if I have connections within Avenues already?</p>
        <p class="blurbbl ">No, Avenues cares about fairness, which is why our application <span class="pink">screening is conducted anonymously</span>. We are more 
          interested in your abilities, goals, and experiences, which should be reflected in your application.</p>

        <p class="blurbbl" style="margin-top: 3vw; font-size: 2vw;" >&#9998; Is there anything I can do to increase my chances of being accepted?</p>
        <p class="blurbbl ">Avenues keeps track of <span class="pink">demonstrated interest</span>. Attending info sessions, following our social media, and asking questions 
          directly to us will all be kept track of.</p>

        <p class="blurbbl" style="font-size: 2vw;" >&#9998; When are club meetings?</p>
        <p class="blurbbl ">Avenues meets weekly on Tuesdays from 8:30pm-10:00pm.</p>

        <p class="blurbbl" style="margin-top: 3vw; font-size: 2vw;" >&#9998; What kind of committment should I expect?</p>
        <p class="blurbbl ">Members are expected to attend every GM (general meeting) barring exceptional circumstances. Also, members should 
          uphold their responsilities in terms of meeting client expectations and needs, without exception.</p>
            
        <p class="blurbbl" style="margin-top: 3vw; font-size: 2vw;" >&#9998; How much flexibilty can I expect when it comes to committments within the club? </p>
          <p class="blurbbl ">As fellow students, we believe school comes first. So, any extenuating circumstances, whether academic or personal,
            can excuse members from a meeting if it was communicated beforehand.</p>

        <p class="blurbbl" style="margin-top: 3vw; font-size: 2vw;" >&#9998; What kinds of projects can I expect to work on?</p>
        <p class="blurbbl ">No matter your role (Strategy, Tech, Design), you will likely have the chance to contribute in a strategic, design, 
          or tech capacity. For examples of projects, <span class="pink">go to our portfolio page</span> and click through the different cards to get an idea.</p>

        <p class="blurbbl" style="margin-top: 3vw; font-size: 2vw;" >&#9998;  What is Avenues' culture like?</p>
        <p class="blurbbl ">Avenues strives to be a collaborative and fun group of people. While our work is our main priority, <span class="pink"> maintaining a good social
          atmosphere is just as important</span>, and we hope that everyone enjoys their time with us..</p>

        <p class="blurbbl" style="margin-top: 3vw; font-size: 2vw;" >&#9998; What kind of opportunities for leadership does Avenues offer?</p>
        <p class="blurbbl ">Avenues has executives, a board of directors, and associates, with executive being at the top in terms of 
          administrative priority. Execs and directors make up the primary leadership team that oversees Avenues. 
          Execs and directors are chosen from a pool of applicants from the Associate level, which consists of members
          who shadow and aid execs and directors in their duties. Cohort members can apply to be an associate <span class="pink">after as
          little as one semester with Avenues</span>.</p>
